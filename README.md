    b) Achieve 85% water savings in pilot sites.

Phase 3: Expansion & Automation (Years 2‚Äì5).

Objectives:

    a)Deploy 2,275 units by Year 5.
		
    b)Integrate predictive maintenance AI.

Roadmap:

Year 2: Launch mobile app for Premium users (real-time pH/EC monitoring).

Year 3: Partner with 200+ restaurants for Premium systems.

Year 5: Achieve 55‚Äì82.3% ROI across versions.

üíª Technical Setup

Hardware Requirements:
